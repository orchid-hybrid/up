For a party to commit to a message they should randomly generate a key then publish `H(key || public key || message)`. (In our case all 3 of those strings are of a fixed length, so we don't need to worry about length extension attacks).

Later they can reveal the message and key for anyone else to be able to verify it.

The identity of the person commiting is included to protect against replay attacks.
